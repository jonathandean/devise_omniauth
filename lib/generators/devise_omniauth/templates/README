Open the newly created config/initializers/devise.rb and customize the following lines with your oauth settings:

    config.omniauth :facebook, "[SET APP_ID HERE]", "[SET APP_SECRET HERE]"

You must also also define root :to in your routes.rb for devise to work properly. You can set it to anything you want.
See the devise wiki for more information
